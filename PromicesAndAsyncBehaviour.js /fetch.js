//XHR request ke ander async behaviour lane apne app me ek sir dardi tha thats fetch method was introduced into node environment. This is a network based request and fetch ke ander jo error 404 agar aye to wo resolve through milta hai kyu ki .catch ke ander wahi code jayega agar fetch browser me request kar hi nahi paya.
//fetch ke ander koi bhi request with parameters bhi pass ki ja sakti hai uske liye use mdn docs.
//fetch ek promise based mechanism pe based hai thus iska execution context alag se banega and thus after fetching is done the callback is passed through task queue that is prioroity queue in this case which is a higher order queue means if a normal web api and fetch api task are comleted at the same time then fetch call back will be added to the call stack first.
//response in fetch -> web browser + node -> network request is generated and if fetch is able t make network request then it is added to the array onfulfield[] (there are three things that the fetch generates that are data whish is initially empty and two arrays onfulfield[] and onrejection[]) else if fails to make network request then passes error o onRejection and after that the information in either of the two arrays is transfered to data and then responce is sent to callback.
